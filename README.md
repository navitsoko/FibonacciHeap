# FibonacciHeap 
Implementation of a Fibonacci Heap over integers.

Assuming all values in the heap are different.

Fibonacci Heap - a collection of trees satisfying the minimum-heap property, that is, the key of a child is always greater than the key of the parent.
Allows efficient insert, finding and deleting minimum, decrease key and merging two heaps.
